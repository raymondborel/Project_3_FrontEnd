# Project_3_FrontEnd
## User Story 

We are creating a trip planner app that will allow users to select a city from the homepage and add to a list of restaurants to check out.Users will be able to search through restaurants by location or cuisine using the Yelp API and see reviews to determine whether they want to add them to the list. As a stretch feature we want to be able to have different users sign in and create, read, update and delete restaurants on their own lists. Another stretch feature we would like to work on is the ability for users to suggest different lists to each other.

### Technologies Used 

React, Json, Bootstrap for styling
