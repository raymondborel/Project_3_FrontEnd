## User Story 

We are creating a trip planner app that will allow users to compile lists of restaurants they want  to visit using the yelp API. Different users will be able to sign in and create, read, update and delete restaurants on their lists. Users will be able to search through restaurants by location or cuisine and see reviews to determine whether they want to add them to their list.
